## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data engineering pipeline using Snowflake, specifically focusing on ODI cricket data. It includes data loading, curation, transformation, and the design of database layers and tables.

## Design Considerations

Data engineering projects extend beyond writing SQL scripts. Key decisions made during this project include:

- **Data Modeling**: Designing efficient and scalable data models.
- **Project Architecture**: Ensuring a robust and maintainable architecture.
- **Data Quality and Integrity**: Implementing mechanisms to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data.
- **Performance Optimization**: Leveraging Snowflake's features to enhance processing efficiency.

## Data Flow

The video tutorial accompanying this project guides you through:

1. **Data Loading**: Loading data from a local machine to Snowflake stage locations, handling both small JSON files and multiple files simultaneously.
2. **Data Transformation**: Using Snowflake's features to transform raw data into meaningful insights.
3. **Data Quality**: Ensuring data quality and integrity throughout the process.
4. **Data Enhancement**: Utilizing Snowflake to enhance data processing efficiency.
